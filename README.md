# Football Analysis and 2D Mapping of Players

This project performs advanced football match analysis by processing video footage to track players and the ball, estimate camera movement, assign teams, and calculate speed and distance metrics. The output is a video with annotated player and ball movements, team assignments, and other insights.

## Features

- **Object Tracking**: Tracks players and the ball using a pre-trained model.
- **Camera Movement Estimation**: Adjusts player and ball positions based on camera movement.
- **2D View Transformation**: Transforms positions to a 2D plane for better analysis.
- **Speed and Distance Estimation**: Calculates speed and distance covered by players.
- **Team Assignment**: Identifies and assigns players to their respective teams.
- **Ball Possession Assignment**: Determines which player and team have ball possession.
- **Annotated Output Video**: Generates a video with all the above insights visualized.
